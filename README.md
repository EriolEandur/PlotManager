The PlotManager is a plugin designed to aid staff members in the generation of free build plots. It also blocks any non staff from building/griefing other builder's plots. The only command in this plugin is '/theme'.

'Theme' - this command just on its own sends the executer to a new plot in the current theme for them to build on, it also provides them building permissions on that plot.

'Theme set <theme name>' - this command should only be used by administrators to start off a chain of themes. The theme name cannot be the same as an old theme and will appear on every builders plot sign. Players who use '/theme' will be sent to this theme instead of any old ones.

'Theme new <theme name>' - this command should be used by a staff member to create a new theme after the last one. It generates a 109 blocks from the other theme which allows for the 50 block wide plots to have 5 blocks in between (because of the paths). The theme name cannot be the same as an old theme and will appear on every builders plot sign. Players who use '/theme' will be sent to this theme instead of any old ones.

Planned features:
* custom plots based off a model
* the insertion of a URL to the theme thread
* limitations on the number of plots that can be claimed by one player
* plot size changing
* allowance for players to use lava/water inside their plot
